    <h2>My Projects</h2>

    <!-- Project 1 -->
    <div class="project">
      <h3>Celestial of Space Destroyer</h3>
      <p>This project is based on the game Space Invaders. Created a fully working game, with animations and leaderboard. Including a range of interactive GUI options. With the feedback and reviews given, I made changes to the game according to their needs. For example, at the start the game didn't have a pause menu, and with a lot of feedback requesting it, I took it into consideration, and implemented it. This turned out to quite useful, as players can pause the game and continue where they left from.</p>

      <!-- Review Section -->
      <div class="reviews">
        <h4>Reviews:</h4>
        <p><strong>"Nice GUI, easy to navigate. The game is smooth and the animations are good. But there should be a pause menu, that stops the game."</strong></p>
        <p><strong>"Love the different levels/waves after the previous aliens are destroyed. Adding difficulty to the game.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>"The login system is good, allowing the user to create a new account or login in with a previous made account. Overall the game is nice and smooth."</strong></p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Project 2 -->
    <div class="project">
      <h3>TicTacToe Game</h3>
      <p>A replication of the classic yet famous game, TicTacToe. It includes: a sleek and intuitive 3x3 grid-based interface, two-player gameplay with alternating turns, automation win and draw detection systems, real-time game state updates, customisable player marks, and a responsive design. The game is simple and easy to learn, but challenging to master.</p>

        <h4>Reviews:</h4>
        <p><strong>"Nice and easy to play, quite enjoyable espacially in my free time!"</strong></p>
        <p><strong>"Extremely smooth and responsive, with no delay. Overall brilliant game, but could make a bit more improvements on animation and on other things."</strong></p>
        <p><strong>"Nice game, but would prefer to have a main menu gui, where you can select different options. For example, 2 player or play against an AI."</strong></p>
